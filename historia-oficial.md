### Paper instructions

During the military dictatorship in Argentina, women disappeared by the regime
who birthed children in detention had their babies stolen. Elite families
adopted them without asking questions. The truth went against the official
story. This film came out in 1984, very soon after the end of the Argentine dictatorship and
was an early attempt at processing the traumatic realities of the regime. As
such, this film connects with Weeks 12-14 in the semester.

Your assignment is to write a critical review of *La historia oficial* that evaluates the film
in the context of our semester. In order to do this, you will need to draw on
the assigned readings from class. You must use the two readings assigned from
class. (No outside readings, though. Let’s keep it focused on the resources
we’ve used in class.) There are also readings specific to this film on Canvas.
Each paper should include a short overview of the plot,
the important characters, and a discussion of the historical themes that they
embody. Then, with reference to the readings, evaluate the historic merits of
the film. Analyze the readings in the context of the film, and the film in the
context of the readings.

It is up to you which historical themes you decide to emphasize from the theme,
but you must be able to connect them to specifics in either the primary or
secondary readings at your disposal.

Please note that this paper is to be entirely your own work. You may not use
internet resources or other outside readings. Stick to the readings that have
been assigned in class. Whenever you use ideas from those readings, whether
explicitly or not, you must cite them in footnotes. Citations should conform to
Turabian style. A guide to Turabian style citations is available
[here](https://libguides.utk.edu/c.php?g=188584&p=3122379#s-lg-box-9616961). We
will be keeping up with reviews of the film available online. The one exception
to outside-class resources available for writing this paper is the film’s page
on the Internet Movie Database, which you may only use to keep track of and
